Had to setup export config and download required export tools from within Godot editor.

Setup butler

- https://itch.io/docs/butler/installing.html
  - Used Darwin (Mac) URL here: https://broth.itch.ovh/butler

Within Godot, make sure to rename the exported file to `index.html`

Within Itch configuration

- must set viewport dimensions
- must enabled "SharedArrayBuffer support â€” (Experimental) This may break parts of the page or your project. Only enable if you know you need it. Learn more" flag to avoid
